Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the &quot;ISSUER&quot; and the &quot;SUBJECT&quot; sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with the &quot;O&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with a &quot;OU&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

The USB permission model uses the requesting and embedding URLs to grant the requesting URL permission to access the USB device. The requesting URL can be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. So, the urls field can have up to 2 URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL, respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices is granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL, regardless of embedding status. The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means DefaultSerialGuardSetting applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

For URL patterns which do not match the policy SerialAskForUrls (if there is a match), DefaultSerialGuardSetting (if set), or the users' personal settings take precedence, in that order.

URL patterns can't conflict with SerialAskForUrls. Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches with both.

Users can't change the time zone.

New devices start with the time zone set to US Pacific. Value format follows the names in the IANA Time Zone Database ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database ). Entering an invalid value activates the policy using GMT.

Setting the policy to:
 * TimezoneAutomaticDetectionDisabled keeps automatic time zone detection off.
 * TimezoneAutomaticDetectionIPOnly keeps automatic time zone detection on, using the IP-only method.
 * TimezoneAutomaticDetectionSendWiFiAccessPoints keeps automatic time zone detection on, continually sending the list of visible Wi-Fi access-points to the Geolocation API server for finer-grained time zone detection.
 * TimezoneAutomaticDetectionSendAllLocationInfo keeps automatic time zone detection on, continually sending location information (such as Wi-Fi access points, reachable cell towers, GPS) to a server for the most fine-grained time zone detection.

Furthermore, this policy will not block update checks requested by users or administrators.
Starting from M88, this policy cancels an ongoing update when a restricted time interval is reached. The next auto update after the restricted time interval ends will automatically resume the update. Devices updating to a Quick Fix Build will not be affected by this policy.

Specifies the prefix of a target version Google Chrome OS should update to. If the device is running a version that's before the specified prefix, it will update to the latest version with the given prefix. If the device is already on a later version, effects depend on the value of DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion. The prefix format works component-wise as is demonstrated in the following example:

Example value: 1412.</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule">The staging schedule for applying a new update</string><string id="DeviceUpdateStagingSchedule_Explain">This policy defines a list of percentages that will define the fraction of Google Chrome OS devices in the OU to update per day starting from the day the update is first discovered. The discovery time is later than the update published time, since it could be a while after the update publishing until the device checks for updates.

Each (day, percentage) pair contains which percentage of the fleet has to be updated by the given number of days since the update has been discovered. For example, if we have the pairs [(4, 40), (10, 70), (15, 100)], then 40% of the fleet should have been updated 4 days after seeing the update. 70% should be updated after 10 days, and so on.

If there is a value defined for this policy, updates will ignore the DeviceUpdateScatterFactor policy and follow this policy instead.

If the policy is set to false or not set, HTTPS will be used for downloading auto-update payloads.</string><string id="RebootAfterUpdate">Automatically reboot after update</string><string id="RebootAfterUpdate_Explain">Schedule an automatic reboot after a Google Chrome OS update has been applied.

When this policy is set to true, an automatic reboot is scheduled when a Google Chrome OS update has been applied and a reboot is required to complete the update process. The reboot is scheduled immediately but may be delayed on the device by up to 24 hours if a user is currently using the device.

When this policy is set to false, no automatic reboot is scheduled after applying a Google Chrome OS update. The update process is completed when the user next reboots the device.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

Note: Currently, automatic reboots are only enabled while the login screen is being shown or a kiosk app session is in progress. This will change in the future and the policy will always apply, regardless of whether a session of any particular type is in progress or not.</string><string id="DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion">Rollback to target version</string><string id="DeviceRollbackToTargetVersion_Explain">Specifies whether the device should roll back to the version set by DeviceTargetVersionPrefix if it's already running a later version.

Default is 0 for consumer, 4 (approx. half a year) for enterprise enrolled devices.

Setting this policy prevents rollback protection to apply for at least this number of milestones.

Setting this policy to a lower value has a permanent effect: the device MAY not be able to roll back to earlier versions even after the policy is reset to a larger value.

Actual rollback possibilities may also depend on the board and critical vulnerability patches.</string><string id="DeviceQuickFixBuildToken">Provide users with Quick Fix Build</string><string id="DeviceQuickFixBuildToken_Explain">This policy controls whether or not the device should be updated to a Quick Fix Build.

If policy value is set to a token that maps to a Quick Fix Build, the device will be updated to the corresponding Quick Fix Build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

If this policy is not set, or if its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build, then the device won't be updated to a Quick Fix Build. If the device is already running a Quick Fix Build and the policy is not set anymore or its value does not map to a Quick Fix Build anymore, then the device will be updated to a regular build if the update is not blocked by another policy.

Example value: sometoken</string><string id="DeviceMinimumVersion">Configure minimum allowed Chrome OS version for the device.</string><string id="DeviceMinimumVersion_Explain">Configures the requirement of the minimum allowed version of Google Chrome OS.

When this policy is set to a non-empty list:
If none of the entries has a chromeos_version greater than the current version of the device, then no restrictions are applied and the already existing restrictions are revoked.
If at least one of the entries has a chromeos_version greater than the current version, the entry whose version is greater and closest to the current version is chosen.
In case of conflict, preference is given to the entry with lower warning_period or aue_warning_period and the policy is applied using that entry.

If the current version becomes obsolete during user session and the current network limits auto updates, an on-screen notification is shown to update the device within the warning_period shown in the notification.
No notifications are shown if the current network allows auto updates and the device must be updated within the warning_period.
The warning_period starts from the time the policy is applied.
If the device is not updated till the expiry of the warning_period, the user is signed out of the session.
If the current version is found to be obsolete at the time of login with expired warning_period, the user is required to update the device before signing in.

If the current version becomes obsolete during user session and the device has reached auto update expiration, an on-screen notification is shown to return the device within aue_warning_period.
If the device is found to have reached auto update expiration at the time of login with expired aue_warning_period, the device is blocked for any user to sign in.

Unmanaged user sessions do not receive notifications and force log out if unmanaged_user_restricted is unset or set to False.

If this policy is not set or set to empty, no restrictions are applied, already existing restrictions are revoked and user can sign in regardless of Google Chrome OS version.

Here chromeos_version can be either an exact version like '13305.0.0' or a version prefix, like '13305'.
The warning_period and aue_warning_period are optional values specified in number of days. Default value for them is 0 days, which means that there is no warning period.
The unmanaged_user_restricted is an optional property with default value as False.

If this policy is not set or set to empty, the default auto update expiration message is shown to the user in both of the above cases.
The auto update expiration message must be plain text without any formatting. No markup is allowed.

Example value: This device has reached auto update expiration. Kindly return it.</string><string id="Display_group">Display</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution">Set display resolution and scale factor</string><string id="DeviceDisplayResolution_Explain">Setting the policy sets the resolution and scale factor for each display. External display settings apply to connected displays. (The policy doesn't apply if a display doesn't support the specified resolution or scale.)

Setting external_use_native to True means the policy ignores external_width and external_height and sets external displays to their native resolution. Setting external_use_native to False or leaving it and external_width or external_height unset means the policy doesn't affect external displays.

Setting the recommended flag to True lets users change resolution and scale factor of any display through the settings page, but their settings change back at the next reboot. Setting the recommended flag to False or leaving it unset means users can't change the display settings.

Note: Set external_width and external_height in pixels and external_scale_percentage and internal_scale_percentage in percents.

A blocklist value of * means all extensions are blocked and users can only install extensions listed in the allow list.

By default, all extensions are allowed. But, if you prohibited extensions by policy, use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallAllowlistDesc">Configure extension installation allow list</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist">Configure extension installation blocklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blocklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlocklistDesc">Configure extension installation blocklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. Permissions are granted implicitly, including for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.)

Leaving the policy unset means no apps or extensions are autoinstalled, and users can uninstall any app or extension in Google Chrome.

This policy superseeds ExtensionInstallBlocklist policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Google Chrome automatically uninstalls it.

On Microsoft® Windows® instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension may be altered by users through developer tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on chrome://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the &quot;update&quot; URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate ). By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used. The &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

 Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito mode. Read about hosting extensions ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting ).

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain">Setting the policy specifies which URLs may install extensions, apps, and themes. Before Google Chrome 21, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Google Chrome would offer to install the file after a few warnings. Afterwards, such files must be downloaded and dragged to the Google Chrome settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlocklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blocklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

Example value:

https://corp.mycompany.com/*</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSourcesDesc">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes_Explain">Setting the policy controls which apps and extensions may be installed in Google Chrome, which hosts they can interact with, and limits runtime access.

Leaving the policy unset results in no restrictions on the acceptable extension and app types.

Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

* &quot;extension&quot;

* &quot;theme&quot;

* &quot;user_script&quot;

* &quot;hosted_app&quot;

* &quot;legacy_packaged_app&quot;

* &quot;platform_app&quot;

See the Google Chrome extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Versions earlier than 75 that use multiple comma separated extension IDs aren't supported and are skipped. The rest of the policy applies.

Note: This policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed using ExtensionInstallForcelist.

Example value:

hosted_app</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypesDesc">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionSettings">Extension management settings</string><string id="ExtensionSettings_Explain">Setting the policy controls extension management settings for Google Chrome, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. The policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest ( http://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Configure_ExtensionSettings_policy ). If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the &quot;update&quot; URL specified in the ExtensionInstallForcelist policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is a Chrome Web Store url.

Note: For Windows® instances not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

Usage restrictions can be applied to the apps installed on Google Chrome OS for the given user.
Restrictions should be passed in |app_limits| list. Only one entry per-app is allowed. Apps not included in the list have no restrictions.
It is not possible to block apps that are essential for the operating system, the restrictions for such apps will be ignored.
App is uniquely identified by |app_id|. Since different types of apps can use different id format |app_type| needs to be specified next to |app_id|.
Per-App Time Limits only support |ARC| apps currently. Android package name is used as |app_id|.
Support for other types of applications will be added in the future, for now they can be specified in the policy, but the restrictions will take no effect.
There are two types of available restrictions: |BLOCK| and |TIME_LIMIT|.
|BLOCK| makes app unavailable for the user. If |daily_limit_mins| is specified with |BLOCK| restriction |daily_limit_mins| will be ignored.
|TIME_LIMITS| applies daily usage limit and makes app unavailable after the limit is reached on the given day. Usage limit is specified in |daily_limit_mins|. Usage limit is reset daily at the UTC time passed in |reset_at|.
This policy is only used for child users.
This policy is complementary to 'UsageTimeLimit'. Restrictions specified in 'UsageTimeLimit' like screen time and bedtime will be enforced regardless of 'PerAppTimeLimits'.

The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0-7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be use in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

|overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
* If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.
* |LOCK| temporarily locks a user session until the next time_window_limit or time_usage_limit starts.
* |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
|created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation, it is sent as a String because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action. Also if the override was created before the last change of the active time_window_limit or time_usage_window it should not be applied.

Multiple overrides may be sent, the newest valid entry is the one that is going to be applied.

There are 4 actions:

* The screen dims if the user is idle for the time specified by ScreenDim.

* The screen turns off if the user is idle for the time specified by ScreenOff.

* A warning dialog appears if the user remains idle for the time specified by IdleWarning. It warns the user that the idle action will be taken and only appears if the idle action is to sign out or shut down.

* The action specified by IdleAction is taken if the user is idle for the time specified by Idle.

For each of the above actions, the delay should be specified in milliseconds and must be set to a value greater than zero to trigger the corresponding action. If the delay is set to zero, Google Chrome OS won't take the corresponding action.

For each of the above delays, when the time is unset, a default value is used.

ScreenDim values will be clamped to be less than or equal to ScreenOff. ScreenOff and IdleWarning will be clamped to be less than or equal to Idle.

IdleAction can be one of 4 actions:

* Logout

* Shutdown

* DoNothing

the feature on the Settings page.</string><string id="RemoteAccess_group">Remote access</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList">Configure the required domain names for remote access clients</string><string id="RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies the client domain names that are imposed on remote access clients, and users can't change them. Only clients from one of the specified domains can connect to the host.

Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset applies the default policy for the connection type. For remote assistance, this allows clients from any domain to connect to the host. For anytime remote access, only the host owner can connect.

If this policy is set to 'EnhancedProtection' (value 2), Safe Browsing is always active in the enhanced mode, which provides better security, but requires sharing more browsing information with Google.

If you set this policy as mandatory, users cannot change or override the Safe Browsing setting in Google Chrome.

Its password protection service won't check for password reuse.

Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means default Safe Browsing protection applies to all resources.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently on the login screen, without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled or disabled by the user.

Permissions requested by the apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction, including any additional permissions requested by future versions of the app/extension. Google Chrome restricts the set of permissions that the extensions can request.

Note that, for security and privacy reasons, only apps and extensions that belong to the allow list bundled into Google Chrome can be installed. All other items will be ignored.

If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Google Chrome.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on chrome://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL, if specified, should point to an update manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is &quot;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;). Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.

For example, khpfeaanjngmcnplbdlpegiifgpfgdco;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the Smart Card Connector app from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

An example usage is to configure a device-wide certificate to be presented to the SAML IdP.

The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { &quot;pattern&quot;: &quot;$URL_PATTERN&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { &quot;ISSUER&quot;: { &quot;CN&quot;: &quot;$ISSUER_CN&quot; } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the &quot;ISSUER&quot; and the &quot;SUBJECT&quot; sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with the &quot;O&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a &quot;SUBJECT&quot; section with a &quot;OU&quot; value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.



If this policy is left not set, no auto-selection will be done for any site.

The available data types are 'browsing_history', 'download_history', 'cookies_and_other_site_data', 'cached_images_and_files', 'password_signin', 'autofill', 'site_settings' and 'hosted_app_data'.
Chrome will regularly remove data of selected types that is older than 'time_to_live_in_hours'. As this deletion only happens in certain intervals, some data might live for slightly longer but never more than twice its expected 'time_to_live_in_hours'.
This policy requires the SyncDisabled policy to be set to true, otherwise it will be ignored.

These authentication webpages, starting from the captive portal sign-in page until Chrome detects a successful internet connection, open in a separate window, ignoring all policy settings and restrictions for the current user. This policy only takes effect if a proxy is set up (by policy, extension, or the user in chrome://settings).

Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the hash must meet one of these conditions:

* It's of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.

* It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the certificate chain. That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute.

* It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn't trust those certificates.

A URL pattern follows this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ).

Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

The USB permission model uses the requesting and embedding URLs to grant the requesting URL permission to access the USB device. The requesting URL can be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. So, the urls field can have up to 2 URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL, respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices is granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL, regardless of embedding status. The URLs must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures, and will be removed in the future.</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList">List of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check</string><string id="HSTSPolicyBypassList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that are exempt from the HSTS policy check that could upgrade requests from http to https.

This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality
on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a
minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when
enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

If this policy is set to enabled then the feature will be force enabled, and
users will not be able to override this.

If this policy is set to disabled then the feature will be force disabled, and
users will not be able to override this.

If this policy is left unset then the feature will be controlled by its
own internal logic, which can be manually configured by users.

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent
value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full
restart is required to ensure that all loaded tabs receive a consistent
policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different
values of this policy.
</string><string id="IntranetRedirectBehavior">Intranet Redirection Behavior</string><string id="IntranetRedirectBehavior_Explain">This policy configures behavior for intranet redirection via DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

If this policy is not set, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled is a related policy that may also disable DNS interception checks; this policy is a more flexible version which may separately control intranet redirection infobars and may be expanded in the future.

For example, specifying https://example.com/ isolates https://foo.example.com/ as part of the https://example.com/ site.

Setting it to off or leaving it unset lets users change this setting.

Note: For Android, use the IsolateOriginsAndroid policy instead.

Keys are designated for corporate usage only if they're generated using the chrome.enterprise.platformKeys API on a managed account. Users can't grant or withdraw access to corporate keys to or from extensions or Android applications.

By default, an extension or an Android applications can't use a key designated for corporate usage, which is equivalent to setting allowCorporateKeyUsage to False for it. Only if allowCorporateKeyUsage is set to True for an extension or an Android application can it use any platform key marked for corporate usage to sign arbitrary data. Only grant this permission if the extension or the Android application is trusted to secure access to the key against attackers.

</string><string id="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomains">Suppress lookalike domain warnings on domains</string><string id="LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomains_Explain">This policy prevents the display of lookalike URL warnings on the sites listed. These warnings are typically shown on sites that Google Chrome believes might be trying to spoof another site the user is familiar with.

If the policy is enabled and set to one or more domains, no lookalike warnings pages will be shown when the user visits pages on that domain.

If the policy is disabled, not set, or set to an empty list, warnings may appear on any site the user visits.

A hostname can be allowed with a complete host match, or any domain match. For example, a URL like &quot;https://foo.example.com/bar&quot; may have warnings suppressed if this list includes either &quot;foo.example.com&quot; or &quot;example.com&quot;.

These keys hold the bookmark's name and target. Admins can set up a subfolder by defining a bookmark without a &quot;url&quot; key, but with an additional &quot;children&quot; key. This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, &quot;google.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://google.com/&quot;.

Users can't change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is &quot;Managed bookmarks&quot; but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as its value. Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and extensions can't modify them.

If the preferred app is on the lock screen, a UI element for launching the preferred note-taking app appears on the screen. When launched, the app can create a window on top of the lock screen and create notes in this context. The app can import created notes to the primary user session, when the session is unlocked. Only Google Chrome note-taking apps are supported on the lock screen.

Setting the policy means users can turn on an app on the lock screen if the app's extension ID is in the policy list value. So, setting it to an empty list will turn off note-taking on the lock screen. The policy with an app ID doesn't necessarily mean that users can turn the app on as a note-taking app on the lock screen. For example, on Google Chrome 61, the set of available apps is also restricted by the platform.

Organizations can specify origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development, so developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled &quot;Not Secure&quot; in the address bar.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. The policy overrides the command-line flag and UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

Note: Policy notifications force a refresh when the policy changes, making frequent refreshes unnecessary. So, if the platform supports these notifications, the refresh delay is 24 hours (ignoring defaults and the value of this policy).</string><string id="PrimaryMouseButtonSwitch">Switch the primary mouse button to the right button</string><string id="PrimaryMouseButtonSwitch_Explain">Switch the primary mouse button to the right button.

If this policy is set to enabled, the right button of the mouse will always be the primary key.

If this policy is set to disabled, the left button of the mouse will always be the primary key.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If this policy is left unset, the left button of the mouse will be the primary key initially, but can be switched by the user anytime.</string><string id="PromptForDownloadLocation">Ask where to save each file before downloading</string><string id="PromptForDownloadLocation_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means users are asked where to save each file before downloading. Setting the policy to Disabled has downloads start immediately, and users aren't asked where to save the file.

Leaving the policy unset lets users change this setting.</string><string id="ProxySettings">Proxy settings</string><string id="ProxySettings_Explain">Setting the policy configures the proxy settings for Chrome and ARC-apps, which ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

 Leaving the policy unset lets users choose their proxy settings.

 Setting the ProxySettings policy accepts the following fields:
   * ProxyMode, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings
   * ProxyPacUrl, a URL to a proxy .pac file
   * ProxyServer, a URL of the proxy server
   * ProxyBypassList, a list of proxy hosts that Google Chrome bypasses

 The ProxyServerMode field is deprecated in favor of the ProxyMode field, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

  For ProxyMode, if you choose the value:
    * direct, a proxy is never used and all other fields are ignored.
    * system, the systems's proxy is used and all other fields are ignored.
    * auto_detect, all other fields are ignored.
    * fixed_server, the ProxyServer and ProxyBypassList fields are used.
    * pac_script, the ProxyPacUrl and ProxyBypassList fields are used.

Setting the policy to Disabled disallows the use of QUIC protocol.</string><string id="RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod">Set the time of the first user relaunch notification</string><string id="RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod_Explain">Allows you to set the time period, in milliseconds, between the first notification that a Google Chrome OS device must be restarted to apply a pending update and the end of the time period specified by the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy.

If not set, the default period of 259200000 milliseconds (three days) is used for Google Chrome OS devices.</string><string id="RelaunchNotification">Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required</string><string id="RelaunchNotification_Explain">Notify users that Google Chrome must be relaunched or Google Chrome OS must be restarted to apply a pending update.

This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, Google Chrome indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while Google Chrome OS indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for Google Chrome and four days for Google Chrome OS, and may be configured via the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy setting.

The user's session is restored following the relaunch/restart.</string><string id="RelaunchNotification_Recommended">Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is recommended</string><string id="RelaunchNotification_Required">Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a relaunch is required</string><string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod">Set the time period for update notifications</string><string id="RelaunchNotificationPeriod_Explain">Allows you to set the time period, in milliseconds, over which users are notified that Google Chrome must be relaunched or that a Google Chrome OS device must be restarted to apply a pending update.

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Google Chrome OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Google Chrome browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

If this policy is set to false, signing in to a different Google Account from a non-Incognito browser content area and Android applications will not be allowed.

If this policy is unset or set to true, the default behavior will be used: signing in to a different Google Account from the browser content area and Android applications will be allowed, except for child accounts where it will be blocked for non-Incognito content area.

In case signing in to a different account shouldn't be allowed via the Incognito mode, consider blocking that mode using the IncognitoModeAvailability policy.

Note that users will be able to access Google services in an unauthenticated state by blocking their cookies.</string><string id="SecurityKeyPermitAttestation">URLs/domains automatically permitted direct Security Key attestation</string><string id="SecurityKeyPermitAttestation_Explain">Setting the policy specifies URLs and domains for which no prompt appears when attestation certificates from Security Keys are requested. A signal is also sent to the Security Key indicating that individual attestation may be used. Without this, when sites request attestation of Security Keys, users are prompted in Google Chrome version 65 and later.

URLs will only match as U2F appIDs. Domains only match as webauthn RP IDs. So to cover both U2F and webauthn APIs, list the appID URL and domain for a given site.

Example value:

The user is informed about the remaining time by a countdown timer shown in the system tray.

When this policy is not set, the session length is not limited.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to a range of 30 seconds to 24 hours.</string><string id="SessionLocales">Set the recommended locales for a managed session</string><string id="SessionLocales_Explain">Setting the policy (as recommended only) moves recommended locales for a managed session to the top of the list, in the order in which they appear in the policy. The first recommended locale is preselected.

If not set, the current UI locale is preselected.

For more than one recommended locale, the assumption is that users want to choose among these locales. Locale and keyboard layout selection is prominent when starting a managed session. Otherwise, the assumption is that most users want the preselected locale. Locale and keyboard layout selection is less prominent when starting a managed session.

If you set the policy and turn automatic sign-in on (see the DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginId and DeviceLocalAccountAutoLoginDelay policies), the managed session uses the first recommended locale and the most popular matching keyboard layout.

The preselected keyboard layout is always the most popular layout matching the preselected locale. Users can always choose any locale supported by Google Chrome OS for their session.

Setting the policy to False prevents Signed HTTP Exchanges from loading.</string><string id="SitePerProcess">Enable Site Isolation for every site</string><string id="SitePerProcess_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled isolates all sites. (Each site runs in its own process.) Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset doesn't turn off site isolation, but it lets users opt out (for example, by using Disable site isolation in chrome://flags).

IsolateOrigins might also be useful for fine-tuning origins. On Google Chrome OS version 76 and earlier, set the DeviceLoginScreenSitePerProcess device policy to the same value. (Because if the values don't match, a delay can occur when entering a user session.)

Note: For Android, use the SitePerProcessAndroid policy instead.</string><string id="SmartLockSigninAllowed">Allow Smart Lock Signin to be used.</string><string id="SmartLockSigninAllowed_Explain">If this setting is enabled, users will be allowed to sign into their account with Smart Lock. This is more permissive than usual Smart Lock behavior which only allows users to unlock their screen.

On Microsoft® Windows®, Google Chrome OS and Linux®, spellcheck languages can be switched on or off individually, so users can still turn spellcheck off by switching off every spellcheck language. To avoid that, use the SpellcheckLanguage to force-enable specific spellcheck languages.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off spellcheck from all sources, and users can't turn it on. The SpellCheckServiceEnabled, SpellcheckLanguage and SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist policies have no effect when this policy is set to False.

See that policy's description for the format of entries of this list. For example, setting URLBlocklist to * will block all requests, and you can use this policy to allow access to a limited list of URLs. Use it to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths, using the format specified at ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format ). The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The URLAllowlist policy takes precedence over URLBlocklist. This policy is limited to 1,000 entries.

This policy also allows enabling the automatic invocation by the browser of external application registered as protocol handlers for the listed protocols like &quot;tel:&quot; or &quot;ssh:&quot;.

Leaving the policy unset allows no exceptions to URLBlocklist.

On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

If not set, then URL-keyed anonymized data collection at first, but users can change it.</string><string id="UserAgentClientHintsEnabled">Control the User-Agent Client Hints feature.</string><string id="UserAgentClientHintsEnabled_Explain">When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers providing information about the user browser and environment.

This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.

If this policy is enabled or not set the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If the policy is disabled the feature is unavailable.

This enterprise policy is for short-term adaptation purposes and will be available at least until Chrome 91.</string><string id="UserAvatarImage">User avatar image</string><string id="UserAvatarImage_Explain">This policy allows you to configure the avatar image representing the user on the login screen. The policy is set by specifying the URL from which Google Chrome OS can download the avatar image and a cryptographic hash used to verify the integrity of the download. The image must be in JPEG format, its size must not exceed 512kB. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The avatar image is downloaded and cached. It will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

If this policy is set, Google Chrome OS will download and use the avatar image.

If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

If the policy is left not set, the user can choose the avatar image representing them on the login screen.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=UserAvatarImage for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

{
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/avatar.jpg&quot;, 
  &quot;hash&quot;: &quot;deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef&quot;

Please start using the multi-line textbox below.)</string><string id="UserDisplayName">Set the display name for device-local accounts</string><string id="UserDisplayName_Explain">Controls the account name Google Chrome OS shows on the login screen for the corresponding device-local account.

If this policy is set, the login screen will use the specified string in the picture-based login chooser for the corresponding device-local account.

If the policy is left not set, Google Chrome OS will use the device-local account's email account ID as the display name on the login screen.

This policy is ignored for regular user accounts.

Example value: Policy User</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed">Allow user feedback</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users send feedback to Google through Menu &gt; Help &gt; Report an Issue or key combination.

Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't send feedback to Google.</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny video capture</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means that, with the exception of URLs set in the VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list, users get prompted for video capture access.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off prompts, and video capture is only available to URLs set in the VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list.

Note: The policy affects all video input (not just the built-in camera).</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Setting the policy means you specify the URL list whose patterns get matched to the security origin of the requesting URL. A match grants access to video capture devices without prompt

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

If the policy is set to true or left unset, the user will be able to use VM management CLI.
Otherwise, all of VM management CLI is disabled and hidden.
</string><string id="VpnConfigAllowed">Allow the user to manage VPN connections</string><string id="VpnConfigAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users manage (disconnect or modify) VPN connections. If the VPN connection is created using a VPN app, the UI inside the app isn't affected. So, users might still be able to use the app to modify the VPN connection. Use this policy with the Always on VPN feature, which lets the admin decide to establish a VPN connection when starting a device.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off the Google Chrome OS user interfaces that would let the user disconnect or modify VPN connections.</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled">Enable WPAD optimization</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset turns on WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) optimization in Google Chrome.

Setting the policy to Disabled turns off WPAD optimization, causing Google Chrome to wait longer for DNS-based WPAD servers.

Whether or not this policy is set, users can't change the WPAD optimization setting.</string><string id="WallpaperImage">Wallpaper image</string><string id="WallpaperImage_Explain">If you set the policy, Google Chrome OS

downloads and uses the wallpaper image you set for the user's desktop and sign-in screen background, and users can't change it. Specify the URL (that's accessible without authentication) which Google Chrome OS

can download the wallpaper image from, as well as a cryptographic hash (in JPEG format with a file size up to 16 MB) to verify its integrity.

If not set, users choose the image for the desktop and sign-in screen background.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=WallpaperImage for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

Please start using the multi-line textbox below.)</string><string id="WebAppInstallForceList">Configure list of force-installed Web Apps</string><string id="WebAppInstallForceList_Explain">Setting the policy specifies a list of web apps that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member: url (the URL of the web app to install) and 2 optional members: default_launch_container (for how the web app opens—a new tab is the default) and create_desktop_shortcut (True if you want to create Linux and Windows® desktop shortcuts).

See PinnedLauncherApps for pinning apps to the Google Chrome OS shelf.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=WebAppInstallForceList for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

versions of the TLS/DTLS (DTLS 1.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1) protocols.
When this policy is disabled or not set, these TLS/DTLS versions are
disabled.

This policy is temporary and will be removed in a future version
of Google Chrome.</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed">Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed_Explain">Setting the policy to Enabled means Google Chrome can collect WebRTC event logs from Google services such as Hangouts Meet and upload them to Google. These logs have diagnostic information for debugging issues with audio or video meetings in Google Chrome, such as the time and size of RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs have no audio or video content from the meeting. To make debugging easier, Google might associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself.

Setting the policy to Disabled results in no collection or uploading of such logs.

Leaving the policy unset on versions up to and including M76 means Google Chrome defaults to not being able to collect and upload these logs. Starting at M77, Google Chrome defaults to being able to collect and upload these logs from most profiles affected by cloud-based, user-level enterprise policies. From M77 up to and including M80, Google Chrome can also collect and upload these logs by default from profiles affected by Google Chrome on-premise management.</string><string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls">URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates</string><string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls_Explain">Patterns in this list will be matched against the security origin of the requesting URL.
If a match is found or chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns is Disabled, the local IP addresses are shown in WebRTC ICE candidates.
Otherwise, local IP addresses are concealed with mDNS hostnames.
Please note that this policy weakens the protection of local IPs if needed by administrators.

If the policy is not set, or if it is set to the empty string or an invalid port range, WebRTC is allowed to use any available local UDP port.

Example value: 10000-11999</string><string id="WifiSyncAndroidAllowed">Allow Wi-Fi network configurations to be synced across Google Chrome OS devices and a connected Android phone.</string><string id="WifiSyncAndroidAllowed_Explain">If this setting is enabled, users will be allowed to sync Wi-Fi network configurations between their Google Chrome OS device(s) and a connected Android phone. Before Wi-Fi network configurations can sync, users must explicitly opt in to this feature by completing a setup flow.

If this setting is disabled, users will not be allowed to sync Wi-Fi network configurations.

This feature depends on the wifiConfigurations datatype in Chrome Sync being enabled. If wifiConfigurations is disabled in the SyncTypesListDisabled policy, or Chrome Sync is disabled in the SyncDisabled policy this feature will not be enabled.

If this policy is left not set, the default is not allowed for managed users.</string></stringTable><presentationTable><presentation id="ShowAccessibilityOptionsInSystemTrayMenu"/><presentation id="LargeCursorEnabled"/><presentation id="SpokenFeedbackEnabled"/><presentation id="HighContrastEnabled"/><presentation id="VirtualKeyboardEnabled"/><presentation id="VirtualKeyboardFeatures"><textBox refId="VirtualKeyboardFeatures_Legacy"><label>Enable or disable various features on the on-screen keyboard (The single-line field is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
